Dungeon Game
------------
* - Completed Tasks
EVEN MORE PRIMARY GOALS:
* 1. Do something

PRIMARY GOALS: (We must have these)
1. Mouse/Keyboard Input (generally complete)
2. The While-True Game Loop 
3. Graphics and its relevant loop
4. A (main) menu.
5. Simple simple AI.

SECONDARY GOALS: (These would be good to have)

1. Items 
2. Network/Multiplayer
3. Procedurally generated (random) dungeons.
4. Dynamic dungeon environment (liquids, gases, and their effects)
5. Levelling up, skills

TERTIARY GOALS: (We should add these if we have time or if it is super easy)

1. At least 3x more inside joke, and more items (LAZERS. Robots, dinosaurs, swords and fairies. We are not sticking to a specific theme here. You're just stuck in a generic omni-dungeon dimension)
2. Smart AI.
3. Items and such loading through the ContentLoader (as in, we can add items and entities by adding text files to a folder)
4. Configurable settings!
5. Non-HP based combat? (Blood, broken bones, amputated limbs, replace organs with robot versions, change your gender, play as a giant rat. Things that make the game more sandboxxy)
6. Line of sight? As in, you only see where you are facing. This would also allow us to put in Xray goggles and have a psychic powers skill.
7. Dungeon dwelling civilizations? NPCs such as lost merchants that can totally barter with you for free stuff pl0x.
8. Lures, decoys?
9. PVP (friendly fire)
10. Even better procedurally generated dungeons.
11. Basic crafting.



Keep in mind, I do not think we should have a specific "theme" for this game. It does not have to be purely fantasy, history, future, or modern.
It can be ALL OF THE ABOVE.
